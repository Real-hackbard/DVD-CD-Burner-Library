### History:
In the past years compact disks originally developed for recording music have also been used for recording data as they allow
recording of large amounts of information in a reliable and economic manner. As a read-only medium they are particularly
suitable for use in applications such as auditing and legal documents. It appeared very quickly that there is an urgent need for a
stable standard for the structure of such compact disks and of the files recorded thereon.

In October 1985 a number of industrial and software companies in the USA invited experts to participate in the development of
a working paper for such a project. The result of this work, in which also expert members of ECMA/TC15 as well as from
Japan participated, was a report dated May 1986 and known as the “High Sierra Group” proposal.

This proposal was submitted in Europe to  for their consideration. ECMA TC15, in collaboration with experts from user
organizations, invested a considerable amount of work into this proposal in order to clarify and complete its technical contents
and to re-edit it in a form suitable for an Standard. Particular attention was given to conformance aspects by applying the same
editing principles as for the other standards for labelling, such as ECMA-13 ([ISO 1001](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10001)) and ECMA-107 ([ISO 9293](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9293?redirect=no)). As a
result Standard ECMA-119 was issued in December 1986.

This ECMA Standard was submitted by ECMA to ISO for processing as an International Standard under the ISO fast-track
procedure, which resulted in International Standard ISO 9660 in which a number of improvements and editorial amendments
were introduced. This 2nd Edition of Standard ECMA-119 is technically identical with [ISO 9660](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660).

# Features:

* ### CD to ISO:  
  ISO image is the name given to a Computer File that contains a Memory Image of the File System of a CD or DVD, structured in ISO 9660 or 13346 Format.

* ### ISO to CD:  
  An optical disc image (or ISO image, from the [ISO 9660](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660) file system used with CD-ROM Media) is a disk image that contains everything that would be written to an optical Disc, disk sector by disc sector, including the optical disc file system. ISO images contain the binary image of an Optical media file system (usually ISO 9660 and its extensions or [UDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format)), including the data in its files in Binary Format, copied exactly as they were stored on the Disc. The data inside the ISO image will be structured according to the file system that was used on the optical disc from which it was created.

* ### Wav to CD:  
  The Compact Disc Digital Audio ([CD-DA](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio) for short, or [Audio CD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio)) is an Optical Data storage device developed by Philips and Sony for storing digital audio data since 1979. Within a few years, it replaced the vinyl record as the most important sound storage medium. The CD-DA has been standardized in the "Red Book" since 1983.

* ### Format CD:  
  Audio CDs use the Red Book standard, which uses an [Uncompressed pulse-code Modulation (PCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) Format with a Sampling rate of 44.1 kilohertz (kHz) and a Resolution of 16 bits. It is commonly referred to as a [Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV).

* ### Blank CD:  
  CD-R discs (CD-Rs) are readable by most CD readers manufactured prior to the introduction of CD-R, unlike [CD-RW Discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-RW).

* ### DVD Burn:  
  DVD (Common abbreviation for [Digital Video Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) or [Digital Versatile Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD)) is a digital optical Disc Data storage Format. It was invented and Developed in 1995 and first released on November 1, 1996, in Japan. The Medium can store any kind of Digital Data and has been widely used to store video programs (watched using DVD players), software and other computer files. DVDs offer significantly higher storage capacity than Compact Discs (CD) while having the same dimensions. A standard single-layer DVD can store up to 4.7 GB of data, a dual-layer DVD up to 8.5 GB. Dual-layer, [Double-sided DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD%2BR_DL) can store up to a Maximum of 17.08 GB.
